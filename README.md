# Algorithms-Visualizer
This is a project made for the Data Structures and Algorithms course with main the purpose of visualizing some algorithms.

## Pre-requisites
This project is made with:
+ Pure HTML and CSS
+ TypeScript

For live demo <https://algoweb3101.netlify.app/> 

## Features
### Sorting Algorithms
+ Visualize the sorting process of algorithms via *Books* in a Library. The goal is to sort all the books alphabetically.
+ User can choose the Algorithm desired to visualize, the speed of the visualization, the number of books and the worst case.
+ **Algorithms supported**: Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort
### Path Finding Algorithms
+ Visualize the path finding process of algorithms via drawable *Maze*.
+ User is presented with a blank canvas in which the user can draw the maze, set the start and end point and visualize the path finding process.
+ User can choose the Algorithm desired to visualize, the speed of the visualization.
+ **Algorithms supported**: Depth First Search, Breadth First Search
